# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Mapper

## Overview
The **Restaurant Mapper** project is a Java-based system designed to streamline the retrieval of restaurant information. Users can enter a restaurant's name or phone number to quickly access related details, enhancing productivity and convenience. This project emphasizes efficient data handling through custom-built data structures and includes comprehensive test cases to ensure system reliability.

## Features and Functionalities

### Custom Data Structures
All data structures, including the dictionary for storing restaurant details, were created from scratch using arrays. This approach showcases an understanding of how data is organized and manipulated without relying on built-in libraries.

### Name and Phone Number Lookup
The system enables users to input either a restaurant's name or phone number. The algorithm quickly retrieves relevant information from the data set, optimizing for both speed and accuracy.

### Test-Driven Development
Test cases were implemented using JUnit to ensure the correctness of the system. Every core functionality, from data storage to lookup operations, was thoroughly tested to handle various scenarios and edge cases.

## Methodology

### Data Structure Design
Custom data structures, specifically a dictionary implemented with arrays, were designed to store and retrieve restaurant information efficiently.

### Lookup Operations
Optimized methods for searching restaurant details by name or phone number were developed to minimize lookup time and handle basic datasets smoothly.

## Purpose
The **Restaurant Mapper** project was created to provide a straightforward way to retrieve restaurant information. It demonstrates basic programming skills and an understanding of data structures, making it a practical exercise in building functional applications.
